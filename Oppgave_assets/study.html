    <h1>WHAT HAS HE STUDIED?</h1>
    
    <p>Now, the assignment so graciosuly given to me by Oslo Met specificed certain website areas, which are the ones displayed on the menu.</p> 
    
    <p><i>By the way, did you notice the slick menu animations? </i></p>
    
    <p>Anyway, one of those categories is what I've studied and that is what I'm going to tell you about here.</p>
    
    <h2 align="center">The Beginning</h2>
    <p class="aligncenter">

    </p>
    
    <p>I started as most others with primary school. I went to <i>Smestad Skole</i>, which is located on the west side of Oslo. Several members of the Royal family have enroled there. That should tell you about the sort of family I grew up in. Not really, both of my parents grew up in simple househoulds on the countryside.</p>
    
    <p>I was a nerdy, weirdo as a kid (and still is) and I spent a lot of time studying encyclopedieas and reading books. For instance, I read Hemingway in English at age 7 and studied the Bible at age 10. Quite a sophisticated lad, eh?</p>
    
    <p>After Smestad Skole, I enrolled at <i>Ris Ungdomsskole</i>, where I had an awful time.</p>
    
    <h2 align="center">The Transition Period</h2>
    
    <p>At 16 I moved to Vienna where I went to an international school. I lived there for 2 years, completed the IB programme and had an amazing time.</p> 
    
    <p>The most valuable lesson for me was the realization that how we do things in Norway isn't necessarily the optimal way to do things. I always believed that Norway was the perfect society; we score high on various quality of life rankings, we're a wealthy country, the welfare state is sick bro and so on. But Vienna was such a well-functioning city and I felt a greater sense of freedom there than I did back home.</p>
    
    <p>As a result I wasn't too keen on returning home, and this set the precedent for my future endeavours.</p>
    
    <h2 align="center">The University Years</h2>

    <p>Quickly after completing the IB, I left for England to study Business, which was, in retrospect, an unfortunate decision. Not because England is a dump or that something particularly horrible happened, but because Business is an awfully boring subject. I did make my debut as a DJ though.</p>

    </p>
    
    <p>After 3 years of torturing boredom, I realized that the job market is satured with hopeful youngsters with bachelor degrees. In other words, getting a decent job with a decent pay was a pipe dream. There was no other choice but to get a Masters degree.</p>
    
    <p>Thankfully my Masters degree was a lot more interesting than my Bachelor studies. The topic was Innovation and Entrpreneurship, and it focused on practical learning. I had the opportunity to follow entrepreneurs, create a small business and research how innovation takes form within a team of game developers. This was infinitely more rewarding than spending hours reading academic journals written by pretentious losers who use archaic words that make their nipples hard.</p>
    
    <h2 align="center">This Page Is Getting Too Long</h2>
    
    <p>I'm rambling so let me quickly summarize my educational qualifications:</p>
    
    <h3>BSc Business Studies and MSc Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Lancaster University, UK</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Learned that Business is a boring subject and that practical learning beats theoretical nonsense.</li>
    <li>The Bachelor years were basically a prolonged Russefeiring.</li>
    <li>Master degrees are more rewarding also because the professors don't look at you as a dumb kid anymore, you're more like their colleages.</li>
    <li>My Master thesis involved following a group of game developers that resulted in quite an interesting thesis, which resulted in me being offered a paid doctorate. I declined.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Exchange at National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Yes, I went on to do a term in Taiwan.</li>
    <li>I stayed in Taiwan for 3 years, but that's a story for another website.</li>
    </ul>
