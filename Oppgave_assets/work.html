    <p>If you've looked at the WHO IS HE? and WHAT HAS HE STUDIED? pages, you'll see that I'm rambling a lot. For this page I will try to be as brief as possible. Hope that's okay with you.</p>

        <h2>Telemarketer at Aftenposten - 2008</h2>
    </div>
    <br/>
 
    <ul>
    <li>A 6-month stint as the most hated person in the country.</li>
    <li>Called people at the most inappropriate hours to sell them newspaper subscriptions.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Busser/Waiter at T.G.I. Friday's Aker Brygge - 2009 to 2013</h2>
    </div>
    <br/>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Worked there during the summers in-between my studies.</li>
    <li>Very hectic job - lots of people eat at Friday's, which is a mystery to me considering how the food is overpriced and crap. </li>
    <li>The tip was fantastic.</li>
    <li>Worked primarily as a busser and waiter, but also worked in the kitchen, the bar and as a host.</li>
    <li>Lots of Swedish people worked there.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Senior Content Producer at HWTrek - 2015 to 2017</h2>
    </div>
    <br/>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Quite a step up from getting fired as a bartender.</li>
    <li>HWTrek was a tech startup in Taipei.</li>        <li>I was essentially responsible for all international marketing.</li>
    <li>I quit this job because the management was incompetent - the startup went bankrupt a month after I quit.</li>
