    <h1>WHAT ARE HIS HOBBIES?</h1>
    <p>Thanks for asking. On this site I have listed my hobbies in a neat table.</p>    
<table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
        <th>HOBBY</th>
        <th>DESCRIPTON</th>
        <th>HOW MUCH I LIKE IT (1 - 10)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Running outside</td>
        <td>I sometimes go for a run outside to keep in shape and to get that runner high.</td>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Reading about various topics on the Internet</td>
        <td>I often go on random forums and website, and spend way too much time going down rabbit holes.</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Playing video games with the boys</td>
        <td>Gaming with friends and talking nonsense is great for a laugh and keeping your mind off the impending collapse of the human civilization.</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Cooking</td>
        <td>Making some nice honey-glazed chicken with creme fraiche while drinking a beer and listing to music is bliss.</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Going to music concerts</td>
        <td>I like music and I like to see the bands I like live. I'm not a fan of crowds though. Music festivals can be really fun, especially when you discover something new. Although most modern music is really bad I think.</td>
        <td>7</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Procrastinating until shit hits the fan</td>
        <td>It's difficult to efficiently complete a task unless the threat of failure is breathing you in the neck.</td>
        <td>10</td>
        </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Traveling</td>
        <td>Everybody likes traveling, but I really really like it. At least twice as much as everybody else. Fact.</td>
        <td>11</td>
