    <p>Petter is a Norwegian award-winning writer, creative, producer, director, pedant and aspiring douchebag.</p>
    
    <p>This website is a futile attempt at coding for an assignment bestowed upon me by Oslo Met.</p>
    
    <p>I've named this website "A Serious of (U)nfortunate Events" because my life (or everyone's lives for that matter) is a series of unfortunate and/or fortunate events depending on how you look at it.</p>
    
    <p>On this website I will hopefully have demonstrated the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Rudimentary coding skills.</li>
        <li>A lack of self-awareness.</li>
        <li>Narcisistic personality disorder.</li>
        <li>The ability to induce light chuckling to whomever might be reading this.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>You might be wondering what the deal is with the banner images. Well, I did not create them myself; they are the work of Swedish artist Simon St√•lenhag. I wanted some banner images, and I chose his work. When I look at his work I get a sort of nostalgic feeling - a simultaneous longing for both the past and the future. But all this is irrelevant to the content of this website. I just wanted to make it clear that I did not create those images.</p>
